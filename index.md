# Our Goal

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, most efficient, and most productive tools to create full stack apps with a focus on AI and RAG apps.

Our first project is focused on apps that need background job queues, e.g. RAG pipelines. 
We're creating an open-source high throughput job processor to make use of external queue systems like AWS SQS and RMQ redundant.

# How We Achieve Our Goals

### Productivity

Enable the rapid development of robust applications. We do the hard work getting complicated code right and provides a simple interface to users. 
I addition, we like the philosophy of batteries included, so our tool comes with a UI and dashboards, metrics, tracing, and testing utilities.

### Ease of use
No new tools/tech to adopt. Our tool is fully compatible with userâ€™s existing tech. So, we're targeting the most widely used tech stack: python, Django, SQL databases.

### Efficiency
Cheaper and faster job processing by orders of magnitude compared to other solutions. Our tool takes advantage of the latest features of Python and Django to enable running thousands of jobs simultaneously even on the cheapest servers (1CPU core, 256 MB memory).
