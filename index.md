# Our Goal

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, most efficient, and most productive tools to create backend apps with a focus on long-running jobs.

The first project is targets apps that need background job queues, e.g. RAG pipelines. 
We're creating an open-source high-throughput job processor to replace external queueing systems like AWS SQS and RMQ.

# How We Achieve Our Goals

### Productivity

Rapid development of robust applications: we provide a simple interface over very complicated code. 
Our tools come with a UIs/dashboards, metrics, tracing, and testing utilities.

### Ease of use
No new tools/tech to adopt: our tools is fully compatible with userâ€™s existing tech. So, we're targeting the most widely used tech stack: python, Django, SQL databases.

### Efficiency
Cheaper and faster: our tool take advantage of the latest features of Python and Django, for example to enable running thousands of background jobs simultaneously even on the cheapest servers (1CPU core, 256 MB memory).
